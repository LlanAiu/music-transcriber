## Piano Audio Transcription

A program that gives you sheet music for an audio file (that's the vision anyway), because it's been too many times that I've not been able to find sheet music for a song/piece that I think sounds good, whether that's because I don't know the name (most of the time) or there just isn't a good transcription that I like.

Written in Rust because it's been on my want-to-learn list forever.

Do I really know if the technical details of this implementation will work? Not really... 

But lowk I think that makes it more fun.
